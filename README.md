## Overview

This project represents a modern ticketing system employing a microservices architecture. The technologies used include Next.js for the frontend, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Ingress Nginx for managing external access to services.

### Why Docker and Kubernetes?

- **Docker:** Containerization provides a consistent and isolated environment for each microservice, streamlining development, testing, and deployment processes.

- **Kubernetes:** Kubernetes orchestrates and manages containerized applications, ensuring scalability, reliability, and easy deployment across various environments.

### Why Ingress Nginx?

- **Ingress Nginx:** Ingress Nginx serves as the entry point to the Kubernetes cluster, enabling external access to services and providing features such as load balancing, SSL termination, and routing.

The combination of these technologies creates a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture for our ticketing system.
